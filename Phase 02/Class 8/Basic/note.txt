1.  n = 5 and k = 3 that means k length er koyta different array niye sum n kora jay
    A[i] >= 0;
    we will use star and bars 
    5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 we need to divide these in three part
    *****|| put the bars anywhere and sum will be 5;
    that means n + k - 1 fact / (n fact * k - 1 fact)

2.  permutation with repeatation is = n ! / same value size factorial1 * same value size factorial2 

3.  grid walking : 0,0 theke 2,3 te utar way koyta? 
    exactly 2 ta up and 3 ta right mane uurrr . er permutation koyta? 3 + 2 fact ar repeatation diye divide
    mane (5!) / (3! * 2!);

4.  binomial theorem : (a + b)^n = Î£ (from k = 0 to n) [ C(n, k) * a^(n - k) * b^k ]
